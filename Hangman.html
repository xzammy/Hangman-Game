<!-- Pseudocode for Hangman : 

Pick a random word

While the word has not been guessed {
  Show the player their current progress
  Get a guess from the player

  If the player wants to quit the game {
    Quit the game
  }
  Else If the guess is not a single letter {
    Tell the player to pick a single letter
  }
  Else {
    If the guess is in the word {
      Update the player's progress with the guess
    }
  }
}
Congratulate the player on guessing the word-->
